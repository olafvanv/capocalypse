        <p>Scientiest tried to warn the world. No one listened. People washed their hands for less than 20 seconds which kickstarted it all. The recent outbreak of the coronavirus was waaaaaaay worse than expected.</p>
        
        <p>Recruiters are helplessly and mindlessly looking for developers to continue work as planned. One is different than the other...</p>
        
        <p>You want to be the very best, Like no one ever was. To develop it is my real test, To train devs is my cause! (I will travel across the land, Searching far and wide. Each dev to understand The power that's inside!) Developers! Gotta catch em' all!</p>
